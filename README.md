## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- JS
- LocalStorage
- Sortable (drag and drop)

### Challenges

`Drag and Drop:` This was my first time dealing with drag and drop, i searched online and found JS drag and drop API i used it but whenever i try to delete a todo after the drag it won't work, then i used Sortable.
